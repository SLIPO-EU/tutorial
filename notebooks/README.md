# Interacting with the SLIPO API and LOCI using Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebooks demonstrating POI data integration with the [SLIPO API](https://app.dev.slipo.eu/docs/webapp-api/index.html) and spatial analytics with [LOCI](https://github.com/SLIPO-EU/loci) against sample POI datasets. 

Indicative configurations for certain stages of the POI data integration are also indluded. These configurations are customized for the datasets involved in the processing.
